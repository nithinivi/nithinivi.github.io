The introduction of `var` was aimed at improving the developer experience in Java 10 through [JEP 286](https://openjdk.org/jeps/286). Java is well-known for its verbosity, and this JEP was designed to reduce the ceremony associated with writing Java code by allowing developers to omit the often-unnecessary manifest declaration of local variable types, while still maintaining Java's commitment to static type safety.

For example 

```java 
//before
PriorityQueue<Item> itemQueue = new PriorityQueue<Item>();

//after using var 
var itemQueue = new PriorityQueue<Item>();
```

And there is a certain amount of controversy over this feature in the community. The blog explores arguments against the use of var are outlined in the following discussions.

### Loss of Explicitness

>Explicitly declaring the type can improve code clarity and make it easier for other developers and future readers.

While the argument against using var suggests that explicit type declarations improve code clarity, there are scenarios where the judicious use of var can enhance readability and maintainability.Consider the following for example.

```java 
void removeMatches(Map<? extends String, ? extends Number> map, int max) {
    for (Iterator<? extends Map.Entry<? extends String, ? extends Number>> iterator =
             map.entrySet().iterator(); iterator.hasNext();) {
        Map.Entry<? extends String, ? extends Number> entry = iterator.next();
    }
}
```

Use of var here removes the noisy type maifest which improves the readabiltiy

```java
void removeMatches(Map<? extends String, ? extends Number> map, int max) {
    for (var iterator = map.entrySet().iterator(); iterator.hasNext();) {
        var entry = iterator.next();
    }
}
```

> Developers are not already comfortable inferred

Java developers have already embraced intermediated intefered types in streams. In the following code 

```java 
int maxWeight = blocks.stream()
                      .filter(b -> b.getColor() == BLUE)
                      .mapToInt(Block::getWeight)
                      .max();
```
no one is bothered (or even notices) that the intermediate types Stream<Block> and IntStream, as well as the type of the lambda formal b, do not appear explicitly in the code.

## Readability

> Using **var** can make the code less readable.

The arugment mostly arises from the fact developers spend much more time reading code than writing code. Robert C. Martin claims in *A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship* that "the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1".

```java
//before
try (Stream<Customer> result = dbconn.executeQuery(query)) {
    return result.findAny();
}

// after 
try (var customers = dbconn.executeQuery(query)) {
    return customers.findAny();
}
```

The focus should be on understandabiltity of the program rather than on the numbers of words which used to describe the program. `var` can make code more concise and readable, especially when the type information is obvious from the right-hand side of the assignment. This can reduce boilerplate code and make the intent of the code more apparent.

>Code readability shouldnâ€™t depend on IDEs.

### Code Review and Collaboration

>In a team setting, different team members may have different preferences regarding the use of var.


# Conculsion
Embracing a balance between explicit type declarations and concise code, developers can enhance the overall readability and maintainability of their Java code.
